    "In the future, intelligent machines will replace or enhance human capabilities",
    "in many areas. Artificial intelligence is the intelligence exhibited by",
    "machines or software. It is the subfield of computer science. Artificial",
    "intelligence is becoming a popular field in computer science as it has",

    "INTRODUCTION",
    "It is claimed that artificial intelligence is playing an increasing role in the research of educational technology,",
    "management sciences and operational research areas. Intelligence is commonly considered as the ability to",
    "collect knowledge to solve complex problems. In the near future intelligent machines will replace human",
    "capabilities in many areas. Artificial intelligence is the study of intelligent machines and software that can",
    "reason, learn, gather knowledge, communicate, manipulate and perceive the objects. John McCarthy coined",
    "the term in 1956 as branch of computer science concerned with making computers behave like humans. It is",
    "the study of the computation that makes it possible to perceive reason and act. Artificial intelligence is different",
    "from Psychology because it emphasis on computation and is different from computer science because of its",
    "emphasis on perception, reasoning and action. It makes machines smarter and more useful. It works with the",
    "help of artificial neurons (artificial neural network) and scientific theorems (if then statements and logics). AI",

    "It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It",
    "is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to",
    "confine itself to methods that are biologically observable. While no consensual definition of Artificial",
    "Intelligence (AI) exists, AI is broadly characterized as the study of computations that allow for perception,",
    "reason and action. Today, the amount of data that is generated, by both humans and machines, far outpaces",
    "humans\u2019 ability to absorb, interpret, and make complex decisions based on that data. Artificial intelligence",
    "forms the basis for all computer learning and is the future of all complex decision making. This paper examines",
    "features of artificial Intelligence, introduction, definitions of AI, history, applications, growth and",
    "achievements.",
    "Evolution of AI definition",
    "AI has a history much longer than is commonly understood, in fields from science and philosophy ranging all",
    "the way back to ancient Greece but its modern iteration owes much to Alan Turing and conference in Dartmouth",
    "College in 1956 where the term \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d was officially coined and defined by John McCarthy",
    "at the time as \u201cthe science and engineering of making intelligent machines\u201d. Russel and Norvig (2020) referred",
    "to it as the \u201cthe birth of artificial intelligence.\u201d One of the initial paradigms of AI was that it revolved around",
    "high-level cognition. Not the ability to recognise concepts, perceive objects, or execute complex motor skills",
    "shared by most animals, but the potential to engage in multi-step reasoning, to understand the meaning of",
    "natural language, to design innovative artefacts, to generate novel plans that achieve goals, and even to reason",
    "about their own reasoning. This general human like intelligence was referred to as strong AI For strong AI, the",
    "primary approach has centred on symbolic reasoning, that computers are not simply numeric calculators but",
    "rather general symbol manipulators. As noted by Newell and Simon (1976) in their physical symbol system",
    "hypothesis, intelligent behaviour appears to require the ability to interpret and manipulate symbolic structures.",
    "While this approach showed promise initially (Newell & Simon, 1963), many branches of AI have retreated",
    "from this approach due its difficulty and the lack of progress coming in to the 21st century. It remains yet",
    "uncertain on when and if strong AI will be made a reality.",
    "The distinction between weak AI and strong AI is also concerned with rule adherence, i.e., the way machines",
    "interact with rules  distinguishes rule-based decision making in which machines strictly respect the rules set by",
    "developers from rule following decision making which machines follow rules that have not been strictly",
    "specified to them. Rule-based decision-making matches weak AI, while rule-following decision making is an",
    "attempt that tends towards strong AI. An example of rule-following decision making is neural networks (NN),",
    "which allow algorithms to learn from themselves. Strong AI would be machines making their own rules and",
    "then follow them, which is not possible at the stage of right now",
    "AI has gone through many peaks and troughs since its early inception in the 1950s, usually referred to as AI",
    "\u201csummers and winters. Since 2010, however, AI can be said to have once again entered a summer period,",
    "mainly due to considerable improvements in the computing power of computers and the access to massive",
    "amounts of data .This resurgence in AI research is the result of three breakthroughs: (1) the introduction of a",
    "much more sophisticated class of algorithms; (2) the arrival on the market of low-cost graphics processors",
    "capable of performing large amounts of calculations in a few milliseconds; and (3) the availability of very",
    "large, correctly annotated databases allowing for more sophisticated learning of intelligent systems (Jain et al.,",
    "2004, Khashman, 2009, PWC, 2019).",
    "Despite the length of time the field has existed, there is still no commonly accepted definition (Allen,",
    "1998, Bhatnagar et al., 2018, Brachman, 2006, Hearst and Hirsh, 2000, Nilsson, 2009). This is not considered",
    "a problem yet, as many scientific concepts only get true definitions after they have matured enough, rather than",
    "at their conception, and given the complexity and breadth of AI, it may not be feasible to expect AI to have a",
    "set definition yet. Still, this doesn\u2019t mean that the topic should be ignored, especially with the recent",
    "advancements and advancements relating to the field.However, without a clear definition of the term, \u201cit is",
    "difficult for policymakers to assess what AI systems will be able to do in the near future, and how the field may",
    "get there. There is no common framework to determine which kinds of AI systems are even desirable\u201d",
    "(Bhatnagar et al., 2018). A similar concern has been echoed by Monett and Lewis (2018), that \u201ctheories of",

    "intelligence and the goal of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) have been the source of much confusion both within",
    "the field and among the general public\u201d.",
    "In the years immediately preceding and after the 1956 Dartmouth conference where the term was coined, when",
    "the concept for AI was first brewing in academic consciousness, many researchers (would later become famous",
    "for their contributions to AI) formulated many theories and proposals that focused on the common features of",
    "mind and (McCulloch and Pitts, 1943, Turing, 1950, von Neumann, 1958, Wiener, 1948). While these thought",
    "leaders were influential, the field of AI as we know it owes more to McCarthy, Minsky, Newell, and Simon.",
    "While this is partly due to their own attendance of the famous 1951 Dartmouth conference, it is likely more",
    "since they went on to establish three leading research centres which shaped the stream of though regarding AI",
    "for years. Their own opinion on AI was as follows;\u201cBy \u2018general intelligent action\u2019 we wish to indicate the",
    "same scope of intelligence as we see in human action: that in any real situation behaviour appropriate to the",
    "ends of the system and adaptive to the demands of the environment can occur, within some limits of speed and",
    "complexity\u201d (Newell & Simon, Computer science as empirical enquiry: Symbols and search, 1976).",
    "Intelligence usually means \u201cthe ability to solve hard problems\u201d (Minsky, 1958).",
    "\u201cAI is concerned with methods of achieving goals in situations in which the information available has a certain",
    "complex character. The methods that have to be used are related to the problem presented by the situation and",
    "are similar whether the problem solver is human, a Martian, or a computer program\u201d (McCarthy, 1988). With",
    "the variety of separate opinions on what AI is, lacking agreement on a standard evaluation (i.e., criteria,",
    "benchmark tests, milestones) makes it extremely challenging for the field to maintain healthy growth",

    "1. Machine Learning",
    "It is one of the applications of AI where machines are not explicitly programmed to perform certain tasks;",
    "rather, they learn and improve from experience automatically. Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning",
    "based on artificial neural networks for predictive analysis. There are various machine learning algorithms, such",
    "as Unsupervised Learning, Supervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. In Unsupervised Learning, the",
    "algorithm does not use classified information to act on it without any guidance. In Supervised Learning, it",
    "deduces a function from the training data, which consists of a set of an input object and the desired output.",
    "Reinforcement learning is used by machines to take suitable actions to increase the reward to find the best",
    "possibility which should be taken in to account.",
    "2. Natural Language Processing(NLP)",
    "It is the interactions between computers and human language where the computers are programmed to process",
    "natural languages. Machine Learning is a reliable technology for Natural Language Processing to obtain",
    "meaning from human languages. In NLP, the audio of a human talk is captured by the machine. Then the audio",
    "to text conversation occurs, and then the text is processed where the data is converted into audio. Then the",
    "machine uses the audio to respond to humans. Applications of Natural Language Processing can be found in",
    "IVR (Interactive Voice Response) applications used in call centres, language translation applications like",
    "Google Translate and word processors such as Microsoft Word to check the accuracy of grammar in text.",
    "However, the nature of human languages makes the Natural Language Processing difficult because of the rules",
    "which are involved in the passing of information using natural language, and they are not easy for the computers",
    "to understand. So NLP uses algorithms to recognize and abstract the rules of the natural languages where the",
    "unstructured data from the human languages can be converted to a format that is understood by the computer.",

    "year, (iii) publication channels, (iv) research method and data collection type, (v) contribution type, (vi) type",
    "of AI and (vii) business value.",
    "A clear finding emerging from this systematic literature review is the need to (i) increase the number of rigorous",
    "academic studies on AI, especially regarding tools and models, (ii) be more detailed on the definition of AI",
    "used in studies, even when it is not the focus, and (iii) build on cumulative knowledge. Research on AI in IS is",
    "still largely unexplored. While there is a relatively sizable amount of literature concerning AI in some way, a",
    "comprehensive review of what is known about AI in IS is lacking. This is especially true for the way AI is",
    "defined in IS, which is still disparate. This study examines the body of knowledge about AI in IS. This work",
    "has developed one of the very few SLRs on AI in IS and has provided a structured analysis of trends and gaps",
    "in the field. The study provides new insights to the field of IS through the utilisation of conceptions of AI",
    "definition, mapping activities to AI, and value relating to AI. We identified gaps in knowledge in the context",
    "of AI research and IS, which provides a starting point for IS researchers and IS practitioners to advance the",
    "socio-technical knowledge surrounding AI. Thus, we make a call for future IS studies to examine AI,",
    "specifically to how AI is defined in contemporary IS research.",
